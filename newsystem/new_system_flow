python3 is installed by default otherwise install it
if pip not installed install
pipenv also
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
#the below uses aliases...py=python3
sudo pip install pipenv
#install youcomplete me
#if does not work with vundle
#check the github of it
#install cmake and co
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev

#to have terminator as external teminal window (a bit laggy but ok)
- sudo apt-get install dbus-x11 
-sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome-terminator
-sudo apt-get update
-sudo apt-get install terminator

- 
I had to create the ~/.config/terminator folder as well as the ~/.config/terminator/config file:
mkdir -p ~/.config/terminator
touch ~/.config/terminator/config

files to create in home:
-cl: text file used to move text between tmux and windows

#bashrc
this is the last bash file executed when opening a new shell
check: https://medium.com/@rajsek/zsh-bash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc-e30045652f2e
*action*: its last command should be : exec zsh #need to add this by hand

#anaconda
run the install process
by the end the PATH is updated with the anaconda path in bashrc.
we just need to make sure that the last command of bashrc is exec zsh, so that till this point
bash is run and correctly set the PATH. Otherwise, the export command that updates the PATH will not been executed(since we are under zsh now)
and we will not be able to run the conda command.


#========== OPAM, Ocaml ==========#
#install OPAM library for ocaml (kind of pip for python libraries)
sudo apt install opam
#initialize the folder  of opam env (under .opam/)
opam init
#this installs opam and ocaml latest stable version

#install merlin lib from opam for vim
#check if this step is manddatory
export TMPDIR='/tmp'

#first install m4
sudo apt-get install -y m4 
opam install merlin

#then run the instructions for vim

#installing opam and ocaml adds a line in .zshrc
#to run the env variables in each new term
#or we can run it using:
eval $(opam env)

#install reactiveML and rmlbuild
opam install rml rmlbuild

#we can use opam also to install Coq (not installed for now)
#install utop, which is a good REPL
opam install utop
#rerun the eval command
