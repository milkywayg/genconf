*move to night mode
*need to fix the power draining
*install chrome
*install git
*clean up the favorite in ubuntu
*import the bookmarks or setup new ones

*suspend does not work properly when closing the lid:
https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/05/lid-close-behavior-ubuntu-20-04/
it will still not work even after. close the lib and then suspend manually
HandleLidSwitch=hibernate
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=suspend
this is my config, does not work

debug:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1239397/20-04-lts-since-upgrade-from-19-10-laptop-doesnt-suspend-anymore-after-lid-clos
sudo systemctl suspend # this works
I enable this:/etc/systemd/logind.conf 
LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=yes  #I comment out it since it did not help
i implement the work around proposes did not work so i remove the files.


*fix power issues too fast drain
https://linuxhint.com/monitor-_health-_laptop_battery_ubuntu/
*install syncthings
**configure to work on start
*for optimizing power consumption
**powertop
**tlp
**https://support.system76.com/articles/battery  (good article, simply follow it)
https://linrunner.de/tlp/installation/ubuntu.html
https://linrunner.de/tlp/usage/index.html#start
***the flow is first install and run TLP the default is very good as claimed. start it (or it will start alone at the next reboot) to start: sudo tlp start. and check that it is running tlp-stat -s
check that also: https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/nq2lul/i_dont_understand_these_paragraphs_of_tlp_from/
***then use powertop, first calibrate it as it should: reboot the device and run only powertp -c with no other programs and leave the laptop as is.
***then check if the system is stable first with optimization, if yes do it permanent.
sudo powertop --auto-tune
above the 'exit 0' line, or add the individual tuning options.
need to do: sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local

*-**-* check why the startup scripts are not executed
https://askubuntu.com/questions/299792/why-is-the-command-in-etc-rc-local-not-executed-during-startup
sudo systemctl status rc-local.service


*bluetooth is enabled by default and will be reenabed at each reboot
https://askubuntu.com/questions/67758/how-can-i-deactivate-bluetooth-on-system-startup
change that
need to do the file executable: sudo chmod +x /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
This does not work. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YDvgPdkWYE
To do that run (it interacts with systemd and do the change on next reboot. we can reenable it by running the same command with enable)
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
then reboot. the button of bluetooth in the menu is off but proposes to turn off!! weird but seems to be a bug, the bluetooth is actually off

*for networking
**ifconfig
**wireshark (https://linuxhint.com/install_configure_wireshark_ubuntu/)
we can start it also with sudo wireshark


*enable hibernation
https://www.how2shout.com/linux/how-to-hibernate-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa/

I edit: sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla

[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate
ResultActive=yes

[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]

ResultActive=yes

to hibernate: works
systemctl hibernate





*issue no suspend when close lid:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1239397/20-04-lts-since-upgrade-from-19-10-laptop-doesnt-suspend-anymore-after-lid-clos


Create a file called /etc/acpi/events/laptop-lid-close with the following content:

event=button/lid LID close
action=/etc/acpi/laptop-lid-close.sh
And create a file /etc/acpi/laptop-lid-close.sh with the following content and gave it execute rights (chmod +x /etc/acpi/laptop-lid-close.sh):

#!/bin/sh

systemctl suspend



**********	*** 
rq: changing all the startup scripts and changing them to exec does not work, nothing is executable at startup. so need to remind to disable bluetooth. this is the most important.
3 things fail: 1- bluetooth, 2- going to suspend when the lid is closed 3- run the powertop optimizations

*************
*todo:
-mouse scroll speed
-fix powertop optimisation at startup
-fix close lid
-enable hibernation ....I think done with term shortcut
