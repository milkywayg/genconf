*move to night mode
*need to fix the power draining
*install chrome
*install git
*clean up the favorite in ubuntu
*import the bookmarks or setup new ones
*suspend does not work properly when closing the lid:
https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/05/lid-close-behavior-ubuntu-20-04/
it will still not work even after. close the lib and then suspend manually
*fix power issues too fast drain
https://linuxhint.com/monitor-_health-_laptop_battery_ubuntu/
*install syncthings
**configure to work on start
*for optimizing power consumption
**powertop
**tlp
**https://support.system76.com/articles/battery  (good article, simply follow it)
https://linrunner.de/tlp/installation/ubuntu.html
https://linrunner.de/tlp/usage/index.html#start
***the flow is first install and run TLP the default is very good as claimed. start it (or it will start alone at the next reboot) to start: sudo tlp start. and check that it is running tlp-stat -s
check that also: https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/nq2lul/i_dont_understand_these_paragraphs_of_tlp_from/
***then use powertop, first calibrate it as it should: reboot the device and run only powertp -c with no other programs and leave the laptop as is.
***then check if the system is stable first with optimization, if yes do it permanent.
sudo powertop --auto-tune
above the 'exit 0' line, or add the individual tuning options.
need to do: sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local

*-**-* check why the startup scripts are not executed
https://askubuntu.com/questions/299792/why-is-the-command-in-etc-rc-local-not-executed-during-startup
sudo systemctl status rc-local.service


*bluetooth is enabled by default and will be reenabed at each reboot
https://askubuntu.com/questions/67758/how-can-i-deactivate-bluetooth-on-system-startup
change that
need to do the file executable: sudo chmod +x /etc/bluetooth/main.conf

*for networking
**ifconfig
**wireshark (https://linuxhint.com/install_configure_wireshark_ubuntu/)
we can start it also with sudo wireshark

************* 
rq: changing all the startup scripts and changing them to exec does not work, nothing is executable at startup. so need to remind to disable bluetooth. this is the most important.
3 things fail: 1- bluetooth, 2- going to suspend when the lid is closed 3- run the powertop optimizations
