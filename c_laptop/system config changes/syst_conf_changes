*bluetooth disabled permanently:
/etc/bluetooth/main.conf  #do it exec
change change to : AutoEnable=false
we return it to true
This does not work. to do that run (it nteracts with systemd and do the change on next reboot. we can reenable it by running the same command with enable)
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth


*powertop autotune to optimize the power consumption
first check that the laptop is stable with it:
sudo powertop --auto-tune
then if its ok, do that as config permanent:
in: sudo gedit /etc/rc.local   #do it exec
sudo powertop --auto-tune
above the 'exit 0' line, or add the individual tuning options.

*do suspend when the lid is closed
/etc/systemd/logind.conf 
uncomment these lines:
HandleLidSwitch=suspend
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=suspend
-- this does not work, I leave this change but try this also: 

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1239397/20-04-lts-since-upgrade-from-19-10-laptop-doesnt-suspend-anymore-after-lid-clos
Create a file called /etc/acpi/events/laptop-lid-close with the following content:

event=button/lid LID close
action=/etc/acpi/laptop-lid-close.sh
And create a file /etc/acpi/laptop-lid-close.sh with the following content and gave it execute rights (chmod +x /etc/acpi/laptop-lid-close.sh):

#!/bin/sh

systemctl suspend

did not work either, so i remove these files.


*around hibernation

I edit: sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla

[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate
ResultActive=yes

[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate;org.freedesktop.login1.handle-hibernate-key;org.freedesktop.login1;org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-multiple-sessions;org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-ignore-inhibit
ResultActive=yes

to hibernate: works
systemctl hibernate




************ rq: i leave these changes but they does not work
