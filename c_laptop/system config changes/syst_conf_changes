*bluetooth disabled permanently:
/etc/bluetooth/main.conf  #do it exec
change change to : AutoEnable=false

*powertop autotune to optimize the power consumption
first check that the laptop is stable with it:
sudo powertop --auto-tune
then if its ok, do that as config permanent:
in: sudo gedit /etc/rc.local   #do it exec
sudo powertop --auto-tune
above the 'exit 0' line, or add the individual tuning options.

*do suspend when the lid is closed
/etc/systemd/logind.conf 
uncomment these lines:
