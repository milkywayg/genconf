copy paste with keyboard:
    enter copy mode: prefix+[
    start selecting: <space>
    copy: enter
    go elsewhere and paste: prefix+]

copy paste with mouse:
    copy using mouse as usual selecting something
    go elsewhere and paste: prefix+]

this works with vim also: inside vim enter copy mode and do the same as usual
with mouse, need to enter first copy mode prefix+[, then select with mouse, finally paste as usual
