copy paste with keyboard:
    enter copy mode: prefix+[
    start selecting: <space>
    copy: enter
    go elsewhere and paste: prefix+]

copy paste with mouse:
    copy using mouse as usual selecting something
    go elsewhere and paste: prefix+]

this works with vim also: inside vim enter copy mode and do the same as usual
with mouse, need to enter first copy mode prefix+[, then select with mouse, finally paste as usual

copy from tmux to windows (maybe works also in term without tmux)
hold shift key and select with the mouse )delect with enter key)

prefix+d: to detach
outside tmux: tmux attach " to reattach

- every stuff selected by the mouse is autom. copied in the clipboard 
and you are positionned to the prompt. to paste just do prefix+]
