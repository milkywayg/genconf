To launch a jupyter notebook in google clous for ex. and use it from a laptop. Do:
run 
jupyter-notebook --generate-config
Edit it the newly created file with:
c=get_config()
c.NotebookApp.ip='*'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.port =7000

then run :
jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=7000

filenally open in the laptop browser at the address:
<ip address of the google cloud instance>:7000 (if 7000 is the port we want to use)

After that: we can setup a password so that not everyone can connect to our notebook and use the computing power of our instance.

Debug: to add debuggger in the middle of the execution of a cell, put inside the cell: import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
